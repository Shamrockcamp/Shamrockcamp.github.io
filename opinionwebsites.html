  <ul>
    <li><a href=https://www.espn.com/> ESPN </a></li>
    <p>One website that I think is great is ESPN. To start, I think that this website is extremely easy to navigate and functional. I like that they provide relevant information such as recent scores, current games, upcoming games, and dropdown menus for all the sports in season. They provide a lot of information right at the top of the page, but it does not feel cluttered. The score scroller at the top greatly helps to keep this uncluttered but provide relevant information that website viewers most likely came to the website to see. In regard to color, the page is not very colorful as the only real colors are black and white. But it does not seem bland because there are so many team logos and pictures that have color in them. I think they did a good job with the colors because if they chose other colors than black and white, the page may feel overwhelming with all the different colored team logos. This website is set up in three columns which I think works well. It is spaced nicely and keeps quick links and headlines to the side while the main big articles are in the middle. The code seems up to date and it is constantly getting updated as breaking news occurs and scores change. Overall, this website is clean and easy to navigate. I think they do a good job of tailoring their website to the target audience.   </p>
    <li><a href="https://tfrrs.org/"> tfrrs </a></li>
    <p>Another Website that I think is great is tfrrs. It is very easy to navigate and is functional for the desired users. Also, when you look up results it has links to each team and each athlete shown in the results which makes for easy navigation because it allows you to not have to search for individual athletes or teams all the time. One downside to tfrrs is it's not very visually appealing. Its main colors are white and blue. It is a pretty bland site color wise but I think that is okay given its purpose of providing information and times about track. Also, the amount of information they present off the bat can maybe be a bit overwhelming. In the tabs at the top of the page there are also search commands that help you find the different teams and athletes you are looking for by giving suggestions and recommendations when you have partially typed a potential result into the interface. This website also compiles times and results from all sorts of timing services and organizes it into one source, which is extremely valuable and helps coaches and athletes everywhere with results that they want to see and helps there be a central database for this information. Tfrrs looks to use HTML5 code as well as some google analytics attributes, which can be very helpful in analyzing their user database and which features are hitting home in the way they want them to. The layout is done really well because it's a lot of information to organize onto one screen and they've done it to where scrolling is easy and sensible. The website is also a little more tailored to a computer as you sometimes have to scroll to the side to get all the information. </p>
    <li><a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren</a></li>
    <p>A bad website that I found was Arngren.net. This website sells and advertises different types of cars and transportation devices. To start this website Is terrible because it is extremely cluttered. There are so many different ads and words on the screen. There is no spacing and things are often overlapped. There is no real structure to this website so it is hard to follow. There is no color scheme or anything either. There are several colors that do not work together and they are scattered all over the page. Even with all these colors there still seems to be a lot of white empty space so it is not visually appealing at all. The text hard to read because it is often overlapped with other words or the pictures. The font is also different sizes all over the page. If there is one thing that were to make sense in this website is the search bar at the top, but this does not work either. There is no padding but there are margins on some of the   </p>
