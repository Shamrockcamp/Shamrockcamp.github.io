<h1>Review of State Websites </h1>
<ol>
<li><h2><a href="https://www.alaska.org/">Alaska</a></h2></li>
<p>
  The Alaska website is my favorite because I think it is very aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. I think they chose very appealing pictures and colors that compliment eachother well. The main page offers many drop down menu options to help you find what you are looking for and it offers a very visible search bar if you want to search something specific. The website has no issues with load speed either.
</p>


<li><h2><a href="https://delaware.gov/">Deleware</a></h2></li>
<p>
I think the delaware page is a very well laid out page. I like that they offer important and current news about Covid right on the home page. They make sure that is the first information you see. The page is easy to naviagte and they offer many options for for different types of information as you scroll down the page. A drop down menu at the top of the page with easy accessible information may be the only thing I would add to this page, otherwise I think it is laid out very well and easy to use.

<li><h2><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">Nebraska </a></h2></li>
<p>
This website is easy to navigate and offers information that is easy to find on the main page. Once you click out of the mian page, information is still presented clearly and designed so you are able to find what you are looking for. Theres is also a search bar offered for quick and specific searches.  I think the pictures, colors, and fonts are a bit underwhlming but not bad. The page loads quickly and has no problem with different sized screens. I also like that they offer a public calander of todays important events on the main page.
</p>

<li><h2><a href="https://www.illinois.gov/">Illinois </a></h2></li>
<p>
I think the colors and lay out of the website is not great but solid. Other than that I think the website is easy to use and offers some features that are cool and helpful. It has easily accessible information on the home page and in dropdown menus like the other websites, but it also offers current alerts and a virtual assistant. There were no problems with speed on this website either. 
</p>

<li><h2><a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">Florida</a></h2></li>
<p>
The Florida website is my least favorite because it offers very little information on the main page. Also, the font and colors are very underwheming. I do not like that they just offer a large search bar across the top of the page. I think they should add more information on the home page along with drop down menus for easier access to information. There was no trouble with loading speed on this webpage.
